# CQRS - Commands and Queries

## What is CQRS?

CQRS stands for _Command Query Responsibility Segregation_. In brief, the CQRS pattern suggests to separate "write" and "read" models, which it refers to as Commands and Queries. In a web application like a CMS, we perform either "read" operations which return information to the user or "write" operations which modify the data managed by the application.

## Why using CQRS in PrestaShop?

During Back Office migration to Symfony, PrestaShop needs a way to access and alter data on the new Symfony pages without multiplying the sources of truth, and without accessing `ObjectModel` (e.g. `Product`, `Category`) directly.

Commands and Queries allow us to isolate the controllers from the data source, which can be later replaced by something else while leaving behind a nice API.

This implementation proposes a "top-down" design, which inverses the classic data-driven design. It starts on a page and the actions performed in it, and then trickles down layer by layer, finishing on the data layer.

## Difference between legacy & new architectures

In legacy architecture, controller is calling `ObjectModel` directly, without providing clear API or separation between read and write model, thus highly coupling data layer with controller. See legacy architecture's schema below.

Fortunately, by implementing CQRS it allows PrestaShop to quickly build new API, but still use legacy `ObjectModel` by implementing `Adapter` handlers. This approach enables us to drop `ObjectModel` and replace it with something else later without breaking new API (Commands & Queries). See new architecture's schema below:

## CQRS Principles in PrestaShop

1. All input validation SHOULD be done during the object construction (see [Validation]({{< relref "/9/development/architecture/migration-guide/validation">}})).
2. All objects SHOULD be immutable unless it's impractical to do so.
3. The `Core\Domain` namespace _describes_ business objects, actions and messages. It DOES NOT contain behavior (at least for now).

### Command and CommandHandler principles

1. Any alteration on the state of the application MUST be performed through a `Command`.
2. A `Command` describes a __single__ action. It DOES NOT perform it.
3. A `Command` receives only primitive types on input (int, float, string, bool and array).
4. For every `Command` there MUST be at least one `CommandHandler` whose role is to execute that `Command`.
5. A `CommandHandler` acts as a port to a Core, therefore it SHOULD NOT handle the domain logic itself, but orchestrate the necessary [services]({{< relref "./domain-services" >}}) instead.
6. A `CommandHandler` MUST be placed in the `Adapter` namespace as long as it has legacy dependencies.
7. A `CommandHandler` SHOULD NOT return anything on success, and SHOULD throw a typed `Exception` on failure. The "no return on success" rule can be broken only when creating entities.
8. A `CommandHandler` MUST implement an interface containing a single public method like this:

```php
<?php
public function handle(NameOfTheCommand $command);
```

#### Code example

In this example, we’ll create a `Command` to toggle the status of a `Product`.
We’ll assume you’re creating it inside a module, which is the recommended way to extend PrestaShop.

If you’re not familiar with module creation yet, see [how to create a module]({{< relref "/9/modules/creation/" >}}).

First you have to declare the `CommandHandler` in your `config/services.yml` :

```yml
# services.yml

# Declare the CommandHandler service
Your\Namespace\CommandHandler\ToggleProductStatusHandler:
  autoconfigure: true
  public: true
```

Then you have to create two classes.
* The `Command` which provides the data you will need in the `CommandHandler`.
* The `CommandHandler` which will process the data.

Create the Command

```php
<?php

namespace Your\Namespace\Command;

/**
 * Toggles the active status of a Product.
 */
final class ToggleProductStatusCommand
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly int $productId,
        private readonly bool $status
    ) {}

    public function getProductId(): int
    {
        return $this->productId;
    }

    public function getStatus(): bool
    {
        return $this->status;
    }
}
```

Create the CommandHandler

Now, you will create the `CommandHandler` which will execute it. Note that your class must have the `AsCommandHandler` attribute.
You can also do some validation and throw exceptions if needed.

```php
<?php

namespace Your\Namespace\CommandHandler;

use PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\CommandBus\Attributes\AsCommandHandler;
use Your\Namespace\Command\ToggleProductStatusCommand;
use PrestaShopException;
use Product;
use Validate;

#[AsCommandHandler]
final class ToggleProductStatusHandler
{
    public function handle(ToggleProductStatusCommand $command): void
    {
        $product = new Product($command->getProductId());

        if (!Validate::isLoadedObject($product)) {
            throw new PrestaShopException(sprintf('Product with id %d not found.', $command->getProductId()));
        }

        $product->active = $command->getStatus();
        $product->save();
    }
}
```

To execute your command, use the `CommandBus` service. The `CommandBus` automatically finds and executes the right handler.

Here's an example from a Symfony controller.

```php
<?php
# Your controller

public function indexAction()
{
    $productId = 1;
    $status = false;

    $command = new ToggleProductStatusCommand($productId, $status);
    $commandBus = $this->getCommandBus();

    $commandBus->handle($command);
}
```

### Query and QueryHandler principles

1. Data retrieval SHOULD always go through a `Query`.
2. A `Query` describes a **single** data query. It DOES NOT perform it.
3. A `Query` receives only primitive types on input (int, float, string, bool and array).
4. For every `Query` there MUST be at least one `QueryHandler` whose role is to execute that `Query` and return the resulting data set.
5. A `QueryHandler` SHOULD return a typed object, and SHOULD throw a typed `Exception` on failure.
6. A `QueryHandler` SHOULD use the existing `ObjectModel` for reads as long as it's reasonable to do so (in particular for CUD operations in BO migration).
7. A `QueryHandler` MUST be placed in the `Adapter` namespace as long as they have legacy dependencies.
8. A `QueryHandler` SHOULD return data objects that make sense to the domain, and SHOULD NOT leak internal objects.
9. A `QueryHandler` MUST implement an interface containing a single public method and a typed return like this: 

```php
<?php
/**
 * @param NameOfTheQuery $query
 *
 * @return TypeOfReturn
 */
public function handle(NameOfTheQuery $query): TypeOfReturn;
```

#### Code example

In this example, we’ll create a `Query` to retrieve some information of a `Product`.
We’ll assume you’re creating it inside a module, which is the recommended way to extend PrestaShop.

If you’re not familiar with module creation yet, see [how to create a module]({{< relref "/9/modules/creation/" >}}).

First you have to declare the `QueryHandler` in your `config/services.yml` :

```yml
# services.yml

# Declare the QueryHandler service
Your\Namespace\QueryHandler\GetProductForEditingHandler:
  autoconfigure: true
  public: true
```

Then you'll have to create three classes.
* The `Query` which will be composed of the data you will need to retrieve the product
* The `QueryHandler` which will retrieve the data
* The `QueryResult` class which represents the retrieved data in a structured object.

Create the Query

```php
<?php

namespace Your\Namespace\Query;

class GetProductForEditing
{
    public function __construct(private readonly int $productId) {}

    public function getProductId(): int
    {
        return $this->productId;
    }
}

```

Create the QueryResult

In this example, we'll just retrieve the product id and the name.

```php
<?php

namespace Your\Namespace\QueryResult;

class EditableProduct
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly int $productId,
        private readonly array $name
    ) {}

    public function getProductId(): int
    {
        return $this->productId;
    }

    public function getName(): array
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

```

Create the QueryHandler

Now, you will create the `QueryHandler` which will execute the `Command` and return an `EditableProduct` object. Note that your class must have the `AsQueryHandler` attribute.
You can also do some validation and throw exceptions if needed.

```php
<?php

namespace Your\Namespace\QueryHandler;

use Your\Namespace\QueryResult\EditableProduct;
use Your\Namespace\Query\GetProductForEditing;
use PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\CommandBus\Attributes\AsQueryHandler;
use PrestaShopException;
use Product;
use Validate;

#[AsQueryHandler]
final class GetProductForEditingHandler
{
    public function handle(GetProductForEditing $query): EditableProduct
    {
        $product = new Product($query->getProductId());

        if (!Validate::isLoadedObject($product)) {
            throw new PrestaShopException(sprintf('Product with id %d not found.', $query->getProductId()));
        }

        // Return an EditableProduct object containing the requested information
        return new EditableProduct(
            $product->id,
            $product->name
        );
    }
}
```

Execute the Query

To execute your `Query`, use the `QueryBus` service. The `QueryBus` automatically finds and executes the right handler.

Here's an example from a Symfony controller.

```php
<?php
# Your controller

public function indexAction()
{
    $queryBus = $this->getQueryBus();

    $query = new GetProductForEditing(1);

    /** @var EditableProduct $editableProduct */
    $editableProduct = $queryBus->handle($query);
}
```

## Command and Query buses

Command bus is a pattern used to map `Commands` and `Queries` to `CommandHandlers` and `QueryHandlers`. PrestaShop defines it's own `CommandBusInterface` and implements it using [Tactician command bus library](https://tactician.thephpleague.com/).

PrestaShop uses 2 commands buses:

1. `CommandBus` - for dispatching `Commands` only
2. `QueryBus` - for dispatching `Queries` only

### CQRS in Debug Toolbar

To help you understand which command/queries are used on a page and how you can interact with them a profiler has been added in the Symfony debug toolbar.

{{< figure src="../img/cqrs-debug-toolbar.png" title="CQRS Debug Toolbar" >}}

It shows you a quick resume of the CQRS commands/queries used on the page, you can then have more details in the Symfony profiler page:
