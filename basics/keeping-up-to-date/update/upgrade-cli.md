# Update from the Command-Line

The Update Assistant module is available through the Command-Line Interface (CLI). Its main advantage is its ability to
integrate seamlessly with a CI/CD pipeline, enabling the automation of update, backup, and restore processes.
Additionally, it can be executed manually through the CLI to bypass common configuration constraints on Apache or Nginx,
such as `php-cgi` and `php-fpm` limitations (e.g., `memory_limit`, `max_execution_time`, etc.).

## Introduction to the Update Assistant CLI

The CLI interface is a unified tool that provides a consistent interface for interacting with all Update Assistant
module services.

To use this CLI, the Update Assistant module must be present in the `/modules` folder on your PrestaShop store server.
It is not necessary to have installed the module in order to use the associated CLI.

The CLI of the Update Assistant module is based on the Symfony console, and therefore follows the main principles of
this technology.

Below you'll find the Update Assistant CLI user guide, with descriptions, syntax and examples of use.

## Generic commands

The `bin/console` file acts as the entry point to the Update Assistant Command-Line interface. When run without any
parameters, it displays the available commands and associated general options.

Example of `bin/console` command execution:

```shell
$ php bin/console 

Usage:
	command [options] [arguments]
	
Options:
	-h, --help                            Display this help message
	-q, --quiet                           Do not output any message
	-V, --version                         Display this application version
			--ansi                            Force ANSI output
			--no-ansi                         Disable ANSI output
	-n, --no-interaction                  Do not ask any interactive question
	-v|vv|vvv, --verbose                  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

Available commands:
	help                                  Displays help for a command
	list                                  List commands
backup
	backup:create                         Create backup.
	backup:list                           List existing backups.
	backup:restore                        Restore your store.
	backup:delete                         Remove a backup not anymore needed.
update
	update:check-new-version              Display the version the shop can update to.
	update:check-requirements             Check all prerequisites for an update.
	update:start                          Update your store.
```

### List command

This command lists the Update Assistant CLI commands.

Example of list command execution:

```shell
$ php bin/console list

Available commands:
	help                                  Displays help for a command
	list                                  List commands
backup
	backup:create                         Create backup.
	backup:list                           List existing backups.
	backup:restore                        Restore your store.
	backup:delete                         Remove a backup not anymore needed.
update
	update:check-new-version              Display the version the shop can update to.
	update:check-requirements             Check all prerequisites for an update.
	update:start                          Update your store.
```

### Help command

This command allows you to access the documentation for a particular option. The help command is one of the Symfony
Console component's built-in global options, and is therefore available for all the Update Assistant CLI commands.

Example of help command execution:

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:list help [command]
```

### Command-Line logs download

You can download backup, update and restore logs to keep track of any changes you made. These logs in
`yyyy-dd-mm-hhmmss-process.txt` format are available in the following folder on your PrestaShop store server:
`/your-admin-directory/autoupgrade/logs`. These CLI logs contain the date and time that correspond to the time zone
configured on your store server.

## Backup and Restore commands

The Update Assistant CLI includes 4 commands dedicated to backup management:

- `backup:create`
- `backup:list`
- `backup:restore`
- `backup:delete`

### backup:create command

The `backup:create` command is used to create a backup of your PrestaShop store. These backup files are stored in the
`/your-admin-directory/autoupgrade/backup` folder on your server.

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:create help

backup:create: create a PrestaShop store backup

Usage: backup:create [ADMIN_DIR] 
with [ADMIN_DIR] the PrestaShop admin directory
--from-config-file=[config-path]: the update config file path
--include-images=[1|0]: include, or not, images in the store backup (1 for yes, 0 for no)
--verbose: sets the verbosity level (e.g. 1 the default, 2 and 3, or you can use respective shortcuts -v, -vv and -vvv)
--quiet: disables output and interaction
--no-interaction: disables interaction
--version: displays the application version
--help: displays the command help
--ansi|--no-ansi: whether to force of disable coloring the output
```

The `[ADMIN_DIR]` argument is mandatory and is used to target the correct resource.

The optional `--include-images=[1|0]` option allows you to include, or not, the image backup during the backup process.
By
default, if the option is not set, images are included in the backup.

The optional `--from-config-file=[config-path]` option allows you to use the backup options specified in the
configuration
file. You must specify the location (`--from-config-file=.../folder1/configfile`) of this `[config-path]` file.

Example of `backup:create` command execution:

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:create admin123 --include-images=1
Your files, database, and images will be backed up.
Starting backup...
```

### backup:list command

The `backup:list` command lists the backups available for your PrestaShop store.

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:list help

backup:list: list all available backups for the store

Usage: backup:list [ADMIN_DIR] 
with [ADMIN_DIR] the PrestaShop admin directory
--verbose: sets the verbosity level (e.g. 1 the default, 2 and 3, or you can use respective shortcuts -v, -vv and -vvv)
--quiet: disables output and interaction
--no-interaction: disables interaction
--version: displays the application version

```

### backup:restore command

The `backup:restore` command is used to restore your PrestaShop store from backup files in the
`/your-admin-directory/autoupgrade/backup` folder on your server.

```

This command also supports the “interactive mode”, which provides you with a contextual action, such as:

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:restore admin123
Please select your backup:
	[0] Date: 12/19/24 10:48:43, Version: 8.1.5, File name: V8.1.5_20241219-104843-XXX

The backup file has been successfully deleted
```

This command also supports the “interactive mode”, which provides you with a contextual action, such as:

```shell
$ php bin/console backup:delete admin123
